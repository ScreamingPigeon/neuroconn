Meaningfulness of connections

connectivity edges is a function of pearson correlation of disparity of dpli across nodes


make sure thresholding works - robustness in dynamic thresholding

global and node level metrics - big picture and small picture

Healthy controls vs taichi - differences, why and how quantified

Analyze the backbone difference and how it affects information flow

granger causality


minimum spanning trees



Processing participants:
- how to pre-process a channel


TODO:
- resilience attack
- icalabel training
- https://labeling.ucsd.edu/tutorial/practice
- meet with max to learn about labelling
- 2 step thresholding
- think about alternative end results
-  


Bad channel identification

- scale the chart to see noisy channels. Crzy amplitude variaition
- Drift over time
- Crazy spikes in the Os because of the movement

- Mark bad channel
- run ICA after it (ICA assumes channels are independent, interpolation makes channels dependent)
-



NEW MEETING:

- Subject 116 - 
	: Rmastoid data replaced with GND.
	: Interpolation comes after the ICA
	: Get more data?
	: We want TCOA against TCOA
	: For 116 copy GND to Rmast
- Subhject 117  EO - only 10 components
- Subject 116 EC - 10 comps, EO-12 comps
- autocorrelation + std dev to figure out bad channels 	

2 step filter
	- upper bound is fixed
	- disparity filter is after bootstrapping
		- bootstrapping is a linear combination of 60 windows
		- do bootstrapping per person
	 	- calcultate number and weight of edges across windows and calc difference
		- use the diff values (vary a lot), retain ones with 
		- all written
	- Use the bootstrapped copies to get the threshold to look under
	- use disparity filter on windows
	- averaging after filtering
	
- Don't do disparity filter for abstract, use jonathan's new code
- set a random threshold, graphs sparsity, keep top 10% connections only
