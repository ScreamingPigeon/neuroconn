Meaningfulness of connections

connectivity edges is a function of pearson correlation of disparity of dpli across nodes


make sure thresholding works - robustness in dynamic thresholding

global and node level metrics - big picture and small picture

Healthy controls vs taichi - differences, why and how quantified

Analyze the backbone difference and how it affects information flow

granger causality


minimum spanning trees



Processing participants:
- how to pre-process a channel


TODO:
- resilience attack
- icalabel training
- https://labeling.ucsd.edu/tutorial/practice
- meet with max to learn about labelling
- 2 step thresholding
- think about alternative end results
-  


Bad channel identification

- scale the chart to see noisy channels. Crzy amplitude variaition
- Drift over time
- Crazy spikes in the Os because of the movement

- Mark bad channel
- run ICA after it (ICA assumes channels are independent, interpolation makes channels dependent)
