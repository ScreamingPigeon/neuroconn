Meaningfulness of connections

connectivity edges is a function of pearson correlation of disparity of dpli across nodes


make sure thresholding works - robustness in dynamic thresholding

global and node level metrics - big picture and small picture

Healthy controls vs taichi - differences, why and how quantified

Analyze the backbone difference and how it affects information flow

granger causality


minimum spanning trees



Processing participants:
- how to pre-process a channel


TODO:
- resilience attack
- icalabel training
- https://labeling.ucsd.edu/tutorial/practice
- meet with max to learn about labelling
- 2 step thresholding
- think about alternative end results
-  


Bad channel identification

- scale the chart to see noisy channels. Crzy amplitude variaition
- Drift over time
- Crazy spikes in the Os because of the movement

- Mark bad channel
- run ICA after it (ICA assumes channels are independent, interpolation makes channels dependent)
-



NEW MEETING:

- Subject 116 - 
	: Rmastoid data replaced with GND.
	: Interpolation comes after the ICA
	: Get more data?
	: We want TCOA against TCOA
	: For 116 copy GND to Rmast
- Subhject 117  EO - only 10 components
- Subject 116 EC - 10 comps, EO-12 comps
- autocorrelation + std dev to figure out bad channels 	

2 step filter
	- upper bound is fixed
	- disparity filter is after bootstrapping
		- bootstrapping is a linear combination of 60 windows
		- do bootstrapping per person
	 	- calcultate number and weight of edges across windows and calc difference
		- use the diff values (vary a lot), retain ones with 
		- all written
	- Use the bootstrapped copies to get the threshold to look under
	- use disparity filter on windows
	- averaging after filtering
	
- Don't do disparity filter for abstract, use jonathan's new code
- set a random threshold, graphs sparsity, keep top 10% connections only



-Subject 202 treated same as 116

12/6/23
Action Items
- Check what's slowing down the computations
- HAL, apply delta over break
- Dr.H wants submit to conf in february, EMBC
- Automatic Bad Channel detection using autocorrelation
- Clean up HAL workspace
- Thresholding operations

- Bootstrapping > disparity > 
- Input : Graph, Output: thresholded graph
- Make it builtin



MEETING 12/19

- Work on barebones 
- Rerun the 2 participants with 50 components (117 EO and 116 EO)
- Bad channel automation not a priority
- Redo steps after double checking ICA

- Global vs local results is a paper of its own, Graph theoretical analysis is it's own thing
- Split the Paper?
- Start with Functional Connectivity, then Graph Theoretical

Question about functional connectivity analysis:
 - dPLI gives directional information
 - problem with using just dPLI, is that with resting state data, we don't get much room
   to interpret reversal of directional talking.
 - questions about general organizaiton of the brain, how do nodes talk to each other? Not 
   what we are doing. 
 - We need to answer a question about tai-chi practitioners? The change in directionality 
   cannot be interpreted in the context of data we have. Reverse Inference flaw in resting state data. 
 - Characterization and understanding relationships. Dynamical nature of EEG to look at funct connectivity, 
   

fMRI looks at changes in blood flow in the brain, EEG much more 'true' to activity.
Explore amplitude coupling. How there patterns of co-activating. Characterize the
nature of these relationship. Main result is huge changes in node behaviour in different modes

Dipole's Hilbert transform of the amplitude of the envelope of coupling. 
Weighted PLI over dPLI: how strongly node i is leading/lagging node j.
What is the strength of coupling in phases vs amplitude? Bands and binding


Coupling in amplitude vs phase changes in resting and active states.

- Change it so that using one person's edges across windows, do that for 
  all subject's edges across all windows
